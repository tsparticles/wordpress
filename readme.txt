== Changelog ==

= 2.9.3

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed some plugins, they weren't loading correctly the options

= 2.9.2

## Bug Fixes

- Added missing shapes to confetti bundle
- Fixed issue with emitters plugin that spawned an unwanted emitters, fixes #4905

= 2.9.1

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed missing plugins in wordpress component
- Fixed confetti bundle package.json
- Fixed confetti.create function in confetti bundle

= 2.9.0

## New Features

- Creating confetti bundle, easier confetti animations usage. Removed `confetti` function from the preset, this bundle replaces this feature.
- Creating fireworks bundle, easier fireworks animations usage.

## Minor Changes

- Added version to the `Engine` object.
- Added `color` and `colorOffset` properties to `split` options.
- Changed default particles `number` value to `0`, the previous default value was meaningless. You must specify a number now, it's easier to implement `emitters` plugin since you can declare just the `emitters` property without specifying `0` particles. If you need any number, you declare it ignoring the default value.

= 2.8.0

## New Features

- Reworked move.trail options, created a `fill` property that is an object with color and image, closes #4882

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed polygon mask position issues
- Fixed polygon mask scaling issues

= 2.7.1

## New features

- Added loop options to sounds audio values
- Added volume buttons to sounds plugin

## Other Changes

- Moved out some plugin specific code from the engine to the dedicated plugin

= 2.7.0 =

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with animation random size, multiplying again the pixel ratio
- Added missing export `EventType`
- Fixed Engine package exports

## New Features

- Added shape options to circle, added range (min/max object) values to polygon and star shape options
- Changed default file for slim and full bundles, using the bundled file
- Added support for multiple shape drawers declared at once instead of adding a shape drawer multiple times
- Added ranged values in stroke width and opacity properties
- Added loops count to color animations
- Improved density values, now is 1:1 with number on 1080p resolution with pixel ratio of 1 (this is not a breaking change since nothing breaks, but it changes the behavior of existing values)
- Density values now has width/height values instead of area/factor, for compatibility reason `width` is mapped to `area` and `height` to `factor`.
- Created sounds plugin, with mute/unmute icons
- Added explosion sounds to fireworks preset

---

## Circle Options

In `particle.shape` now it's possible to set another option to the `circle` shape, `angle`. The new property accepts a `number` or a `{ min: number; max: number }` object, when only `number` it's going to be `{ min: 0, max: <value> }`.

This creates partial circles starting from `min` to `max`, both values must be specified in degrees. If this value is ignored the default value is: `{ min: 0, max: 360 }` (the full circle).

### Examples

```
...
  shape: {
    type: "circle",
    options: {
      circle: {
        angle: 180
      }
    }
  }
...
```

This examples creates horizontal half circles

```
...
  shape: {
    type: "circle",
    options: {
      circle: {
        angle: { min: 90, max: 270 }
      }
    }
  }
...
```

This examples creates vertical half circles

## Density options

The density options are changed a bit, instead of `area`/`factor` values, the `width`/`height` values are introduced and mapped respectively. The default values are changed to `width` `1920` and `height` `1080`, so on a FullHD resolution on device pixel ratio `1` the particles number is the one specified in the options. Since `width` and `height` are multiplied together, they can be swapped and nothing changes.

The formula for the density is:

(canvasWidth * canvasHeight) / (densityWidth * densityHeight * devicePixelRatio^2)

### Notes on existing configurations

Since many configs had a `density.area` value of `800`, you'll see less particles, just a few less. If you have also a `factor` value, you won't notice any difference. When only `area` is set, if you want to keep the previous configuration, set `factor` to `1000`. Since the default `factor` (`height`) value is `1080` now, the difference should be barely noticeable.

= 2.6.0 =

## Bug Fixes

- Improved angular component id management
- Fixed multiline text shape (and relative demo)
- Fixed issues with links colors and themes, fixes #4841

## New Features

- Added new resize object to interactivity options, can change the debounce delay, fixes #4803
- WordPress plugin is now localizable, closes #4807

## Other Changes

- Fixed dependencies charts on README files, closes #4763
- Added reset to path generators, this fixes issues with sea anemone and polygon path plugins

= 2.5.4 =

## New Features

- Added localization support

= 2.5.3 =

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with reduce duplicates flag, fixes #4805

= 2.5.1 =

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed issue with ES modules

= 2.4.0 =

## New Features

- Added `reset` method to updaters, this method will be called after a particle loses a life.
- Created the motion plugin for handling motion sickness, I moved this feature from the engine to a plugin since I prefer to have it more customizable. Everyone now can create their own motion sickness plugin, instead of having a standard behavior for everyone
- Added mutation observer to avoid style changes to the canvas when the `fullScreen` option is enabled (default behavior)
- Moved all easing functions to plugin packages, slim now depends on easing-quad since it's the default value used in repulse and attract
- Added support for multiline text in canvas mask text options, separator and spacing are customizable values
- Added `aria-hidden="true"` to canvas element, fixes #4785
- Removed all canvas context save/restore calls, this should be a huge improvement to general performances
- Added the particles pool for reusing destroyed particles, every tsParticles instance will have its own pool
- Changed collision absorb code, added `absorb.speed` option to `collisions` section
- Added delay to root options, fixes #4766

## Bug Fixes

- Fixed infection plugin
- Fixed issue with polygon mask when particles bounce on the polygon edges
- Fixed issue with `rgb()`, `hsl()` and `hsv()` values in color option values

## Other Changes

- Refactored plugins to avoid passing options in init functions since it's no more necessary
- Removed `initAsync` function from plugins, standard `init` is now async for all plugins
- Removed polygon mask plugin from the `tsparticles` package, this is a breaking change only for those that are using it. Since it's a heavy plugin and not so much used, I have preferred removing it from the `tsparticles` package.
- Changed tsconfig target from es6 to es2019 (less transpilation to a reasonable target). The compatibility is still very high, reducing the bundle size.
